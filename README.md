# Hack Day 2023 - Godot AR Experience

This hack serves as an introduction to the Godot game engine, exploring its capabilities and comparing/contrasting them to other tools such an Unity and Aframe. Godot is an open source, lightweight engine that may serve as a useful alternative to paid tooling, depending on the capabilities and limitations of the engine compared to its rivals.

This project is an example AR application that will hopefully demonstrate Godot's AR functionality by the end of Hack Day 2023.

## Godot Pros

- Lightweight
- Free and open-source
- GDScript language is intuitive, clean, and has built in intellisense.
- Game object hierarchy is clean and simple (Node/scene system)

## Godot Cons

- Very limited support
- Limited documentation and support for AR applications (VR is more supported but still limited)
- Requires installation of SCons for compilation which was a fairly lengthy, difficult process

## Other Notes
